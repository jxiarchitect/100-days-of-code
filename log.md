### Day 3: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on my first practice project. About 70% complete. Tribute Page.

**Thoughts:** If I think through what I am wanting to create before writing code, I can be more efficient with my research and coding. :)

### Day 4: January 9, 2018
**Today's Progress**: First Project complete and in the books! 

**Thoughts:**  Any and all new habits are challenging at first. Approached today with a clear understanding of the exact edits I wanted to complete and worked through them sequentially and systematically. Reviewed the response of my column widths on both the Desktop and Mobile and I am happy with the outcome. Looking forward to beginning my next project via FreeCodeCamp :)
